## Python Bootcamp 2018

### Basics of Programming in Python

#### Pre-flight Check

We will be using the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for this course. Anaconda is a popular software that gives us everything we need to get started in Python - the Python 3.6 interpreter, common Python libraries for scientific computing, plotting and analysis, jupyter Notebooks, and a lightweight IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for more advanced users.

Please make sure that you have `Python 3.6 version` installed for your platform (Windows/Mac/Linux). All users can select `64-bit Graphical Installer` unless you know that you have an older 32-bit operating system.
